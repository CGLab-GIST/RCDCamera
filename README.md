# RemoteCamera (without depth)
Simple iOS remote camera app that pass color image via network socket using AVFoundation and Network framework. It is implemented to replace [Intel RealSense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense) for my personal usage. **See `main` branch for getting depth image with ARKit 4.**

Please refer `client_example.py` for usage.

 1. Check IP address of your device in Setting and run application.
 2. Set IP address as device's in `client_example.py` and run script. It may requires few dependencies.
